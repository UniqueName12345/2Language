# 2Language
2Language is an esoteric language made by me. This is my Python intepreter.

## Documentation

The closest thing to documentation I have is the [EXAMPLES.md](/EXAMPLES.md) file.

## How to use.

Simply run `compile.py` and it will compile the code in the `.2lang` file into a `.py` file and run it.
